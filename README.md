# voting-server
Redux server application PoC.

It's based on this [redux tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) of [@teropa](https://twitter.com/teropa). 

It's a quite simple exaple but it's actually a significant exaple of what can be done with Redux in the server side.

The idea is that the application will give to the users two elements to vote for their fauvorites:

The application will have two separated interfaces: the voting UI designed to be used in a mobile device and the result UI is designed to be shown in a projector or bit screen.
